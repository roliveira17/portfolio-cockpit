# Oil commodity analysis: a market drowning in barrels but priced for war

**The global oil market in February 2026 presents a rare and dangerous divergence: the most oversupplied fundamental picture since 2020 is colliding with the highest geopolitical risk premium since 2022.** Brent trades at ~$68/bbl â€” roughly $10 above where fundamentals alone would place it â€” sustained by a credible threat of a second Israel-Iran conflict. The IEA projects a staggering **3.7 mb/d surplus** in 2026, OECD inventories have crossed above the 5-year average for the first time since 2021, and OPEC+ is sitting on **~3.2 mb/d of withheld production** it desperately wants to return. Yet 170 million barrels of Iranian crude sit stranded on tankers near Singapore, speculative positioning has recovered from 15-year bearish extremes, and the options market is pricing call skew at levels last seen during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. For Brazilian E&P investors thinking in BRL, current revenue of ~R$355/bbl (Brent $68 Ã— USD/BRL 5.22) masks a likely decline toward R$300-310/bbl as geopolitical premia fade and the surplus asserts itself. The directional view is **range-bound to bearish** for 6-12 months, with high conviction that $55-65 Brent defines the trading range absent a supply shock.

## Section 1 â€” The tape says oversupply, the curve says it louder

**Brent closed February 14 at $67.75/bbl and WTI at $62.89/bbl**, both elevated by Iran tensions after starting 2026 at $61 and $57.60 respectively. The YTD rally of **+11% (Brent)** and **+9.2% (WTI)** entirely reflects geopolitical repricing, not fundamental improvement. Over 12 months, both benchmarks are down **10-13%**, and 2025 delivered a **~20% annual decline** â€” the worst since the pandemic.

The futures curve tells the real story. Near-term backwardation persists with barely **70 cents** separating prompt months, but the entire WTI 2026 strip beyond Q1 trades below $60. The **Dec 2025â€“Dec 2026 WTI spread has flipped into contango** for the first time since late 2020, a signal hedge funds watch closely. Morgan Stanley noted "little historical precedent" for this shape â€” steep front-end backwardation transitioning mid-curve into contango â€” which they describe as a "wobbly smile" reflecting physical tightness overlaid on structural surplus expectations.

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Brent spot | **$67.75** | YTD +11%, 12M -12% |
| WTI spot | **$62.89** | YTD +9.2%, 12M -11% |
| Brent-WTI spread | **$4.86** | Normal range |
| OVX (crude vol index) | **51-53** | Elevated; 52-wk range 23-74 |
| USGC 3-2-1 crack | **$22.70/bbl** | Highest since Mar 2024 |
| OECD commercial stocks | **2,842 mb** | Above 5-yr avg for 1st time since 2021 |
| Cushing stocks | **25.2 mb** | 33% utilization, relatively lean |
| Iran floating storage | **170 mb** | All-time record |
| Global stock builds 2025 | **477 mb** | Largest since 2020 |

Implied volatility on crude options is running at **50-53% annualized** (OVX), well above the 12-month average of ~35-40%. Brent call skew spiked **19 points** since January 1 â€” an extraordinary move reflecting hedging demand against Iran-driven supply disruption. Crack spreads remain healthy at **$22.70/bbl** (USGC 3-2-1), boosted by Winter Storm Fern freeze-offs that temporarily removed 480 kb/d of Lower 48 production and tightened diesel balances to their highest since February 2024.

The inventory picture is unambiguously bearish. **Global observed inventories hit 8,030 mb in October 2025** â€” four-year highs. The week ending February 6 saw a massive **+8.53 mb US crude build**, the largest in a year and ten times consensus expectations. However, Cushing at 25.2 mb (33% utilization) remains relatively lean, and the crucial distinction is that **72% of the 2025 floating storage build was sanctioned oil** (Iran, Venezuela), not freely tradable barrels.

## Section 2 â€” Supply: a wall of barrels with cracks in the foundation

### OPEC+ is defending $60 but losing strategic patience

The OPEC+ coalition faces its most difficult balancing act since the 2020 price war. **Total quota-participating production stood at 35.75 mb/d in January 2026**, with ~3.24 mb/d of cuts still withheld â€” roughly 3% of global demand. The group paused all production increases for Q1 2026 after a dramatic strategic pivot: having aggressively unwound 2.2 mb/d of voluntary cuts between April-September 2025 (accelerating from 137 kb/d/month to 548 kb/d/month), the resulting **~20% price collapse** forced a retreat to "production management mode."

The internal dynamics are fraying. **Kazakhstan** is the worst offender with cumulative overproduction of ~3.49 mb/d since January 2024, though CPC Marine Terminal disruptions in January 2026 involuntarily improved compliance. **Iraq** has overproduced consistently at >130 kb/d above its ~4.0 mb/d target. Combined compensation obligations total a staggering **4.59 mb/d** cumulative through July 2026. The Saudi-UAE rift extends beyond oil â€” Saudi forces intercepted UAE-linked weapons in Yemen in December 2025, described as the "biggest split in decades" by CNBC â€” though OPEC+ policy unity has been maintained through the March 1, 2026 meeting.

Saudi Arabia's fiscal breakeven stands at **$94-96/bbl** (IMF/Bloomberg), with Bloomberg Economics estimating **$111/bbl** including Public Investment Fund spending. At current prices of ~$68, the kingdom is running a planned **3.3% of GDP deficit** ($44 billion), financing through debt markets. This massive gap between price reality and fiscal needs creates a persistent tension: Saudi can tolerate deficits for several years given low debt (32.7% of GDP) and substantial financial assets, but cannot do so indefinitely.

Effective OPEC spare capacity is **less than advertised**. While the IEA estimates 4.0-5.3 mb/d total, independent analysts at Energy Aspects and Rapidan Energy estimate only **1.5-2.5 mb/d is truly deployable** â€” concentrated almost entirely in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Most African OPEC members and smaller producers are at or below capacity.

### Non-OPEC growth is decelerating but still formidable

**US production** stands at **13.5 mb/d** (EIA weekly, February 6), essentially flat with the 2025 record of 13.6 mb/d. The EIA forecasts US output averaging 13.5 mb/d in 2026 before declining to 13.3 mb/d in 2027 â€” what would be the first annual decline since 2021. The rig count has fallen to **551 total** (412 oil), with the Permian at 244 rigs â€” the **lowest since August 2021**, down ~60 rigs year-over-year. As Diamondback Energy's CEO stated, "production has already peaked."

The breakeven economics are critical for understanding the shale ceiling:

| Basin | New well breakeven (WTI) | Existing well breakeven |
|-------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Permian â€“ Midland | **$61-62** | ~$38 |
| Permian â€“ Delaware | **$62-64** | ~$36 |
| Eagle Ford | **$65-66** | ~$41 |
| Bakken | **$65-67** | ~$42 |

With the EIA forecasting WTI at **$52/bbl** for 2026, prices are below new well breakevens across every major basin. The anonymous Dallas Fed Energy Survey quote captures the mood: *"We have begun the twilight of shale... The U.S. isn't running out of oil, but she sure is running out of $60-per-barrel oil."* Enverus projects marginal shale costs rising from ~$70 today to **$95 by the mid-2030s** as operators exhaust Tier 1 inventory.

**Brazil** is the standout growth story. Production hit a record **3.77 mb/d oil** in 2025 (+12.3% YoY), with the August peak reaching 3.896 mb/d. Petrobras's FPSO Almirante TamandarÃ© in BÃºzios reached 250 kb/d, and the field surpassed **1 million bpd** in January 2026. The EIA forecasts Brazil at ~4.0 mb/d in 2026. Pre-salt production is expected to peak in the **early 2030s at ~5.1 mb/d** (EPE), with breakevens below $40/bbl and carbon intensity of just 15 kg CO2/bbl versus 20 kg globally.

**Guyana** hit **900 kb/d** in November 2025 following Yellowtail startup. With Uaru (250 kb/d, 2026), Whiptail (250 kb/d, 2027), and Hammerhead (150 kb/d, 2029) in the pipeline, **total installed capacity reaches 1.7 mb/d by 2030** from the Stabroek block alone.

**Russia** is the wildcard. January 2026 production plunged to **9.23 mb/d** â€” a full **344 kb/d below its OPEC+ quota** â€” meaning Russia cannot even produce to its allowed level. Escalating Western sanctions (183 tankers sanctioned in December 2024), Indian refiner pullbacks (29% import decline in December 2025), and Ukrainian drone strikes on energy infrastructure (38% of primary refining capacity offline by October 2025) are all biting. The Urals discount to Brent widened to **$12-13/bbl** in February, with some December cargoes trading at **$23-27/bbl discounts**. Russia's fossil fuel export revenues hit their second-lowest level since the full-scale invasion, at â‚¬500 million/day in December 2025.

Global upstream capex is declining for a **second consecutive year** â€” IEA estimates $570 billion in 2025 (down ~4% YoY), with Wood Mackenzie projecting another 2-3% cut in 2026. The underinvestment thesis has partially receded for this decade but is **re-emerging** as the 2026-2027 spending downturn takes hold.

## Section 3 â€” Demand: structurally slowing but not collapsing

### The agency forecasts diverge by a Grand Canyon

The IEA-OPEC demand growth divergence for 2026 is **550 kb/d** â€” a massive gap that frames the entire market debate. The IEA projects demand growth of just **850 kb/d**, the EIA sees **1.2 mb/d**, and OPEC maintains **1.4 mb/d**. The resulting supply-demand balance ranges from a roughly balanced market (OPEC's view) to a **3.7 mb/d surplus** (IEA's view). This disagreement hinges primarily on two factors: Chinese demand trajectory and non-OPEC supply growth estimates. OPEC projects non-OPEC production growth at only 0.6 mb/d â€” roughly half of IEA's estimate â€” particularly disagreeing on US shale resilience.

The weight of evidence supports the bearish camp. Global inventories built **477 mb in 2025** (1.3 mb/d average), the EIA's weekly data shows persistent builds, and the futures curve is pricing in sustained surplus. OPEC has consistently overestimated demand growth for four consecutive years.

### China is buying barrels, but not burning them all

China's crude imports hit a record **11.55 mb/d in 2025** (+4.4% YoY), with December surging to **13.18 mb/d**. But this headline masks a critical nuance: **~1.0 mb/d of imports are flowing into strategic stockpiles** rather than refineries (EIA estimate). China's SPR buying is effectively acting as demand of last resort, absorbing the global surplus and cushioning price declines. Strip away strategic buying, and China's actual consumption growth is closer to **0.2 mb/d** (IEA estimate for 2026).

The structural picture is deteriorating. Property activity indicators remain **50-80% below 2020-21 peaks**. Real estate investment fell 15.9% in 2025. Retail sales growth decelerated to just **+0.9% YoY** in December. Most critically, **EV penetration reached 49% of new vehicle sales** in 2025 â€” Sinopec, China's top refiner, projects Chinese oil demand peaks by **2027**. Petrochemical feedstock is now the primary growth driver, not transport fuels.

**India** is emerging as the replacement growth engine, with demand projected at **5.99 mb/d in 2026** (+4.4% YoY per OPEC) â€” the fastest growth rate among major consumers. India plans to add **~1 mb/d of refining capacity** by 2030, more than any country outside China. But India's total demand remains only one-third of China's, so it cannot fully compensate for Chinese deceleration.

### The energy transition is no longer theoretical for oil demand

Global EV sales reached **20.7 million units in 2025** (22% of new car sales). Oil displacement from EVs exceeded **1.3 mb/d in 2024** and is set to reach **5+ mb/d by 2030** (IEA STEPS). The geographic distribution matters enormously: China (49% EV penetration) and Europe (20-23% BEV share) are seeing material gasoline demand destruction, while US BEV share actually fell to **7.8%** after the federal tax credit expired, and is expected to decline further in 2026.

Peak oil demand projections have converged significantly: the IEA sees demand for combustion fuels peaking as early as **2027**, total oil demand plateauing around **105.5 mb/d** by decade-end. OPEC remains the lone holdout, projecting demand rising to 130 mb/d by 2050. BloombergNEF and the EIA align broadly with the IEA's timeline. The 3-5 year materiality is concentrated in transport fuels â€” jet fuel remains largely insulated, and petrochemical feedstock demand continues growing, becoming **>60% of oil demand growth** from 2026 onward.

---

## Section 4 â€” Geopolitics: the $10 risk premium that could become $30

### Iran is the primary tail risk â€” and it's not small

The probability of a second Israel-Iran conflict in Q1-Q2 2026 is **25-35%**, making it the single largest geopolitical risk to oil markets. Following the 12-Day War of June 2025 â€” in which Israel and the US struck Iranian nuclear facilities, killing 30 security chiefs and 11 nuclear scientists â€” the situation remains a highly unstable "armed peace." Israel's Security Cabinet authorized additional strikes in January 2026; Iran is rebuilding missile capabilities; and mass protests across all 31 Iranian provinces since December 28, 2025 add internal instability. Iran produces ~3.2 mb/d with 170 mb stranded on tankers.

Indirect US-Iran talks resumed in Oman on February 6, 2026 â€” the first since the June war â€” but positions remain far apart. Trump demands total enrichment cessation; Iran insists on civilian nuclear rights. ~400 kg of highly enriched uranium remains unaccounted for. New US sanctions on 14 vessels were announced simultaneously with the talks.

The Houthi ceasefire (May 2025) has reduced Red Sea attacks from 150 in 2024 to just 7 in 2025, and Maersk resumed transit in January 2026. But the ceasefire is explicitly conditional on Iran not being attacked â€” any Israeli strike would likely trigger immediate resumption.

### Russia sanctions are working better than expected

Russian production has involuntarily declined to 9.23 mb/d â€” below its OPEC+ quota. Export revenues are at their second-lowest since the invasion. The EU has progressively tightened the price cap from $60 to a dynamic **$44.10/bbl** (effective February 1, 2026), and is considering replacing it entirely with a **full maritime services ban**. Ukrainian drone strikes have taken **38% of Russian refining capacity offline**. The shadow fleet (640+ vessels) continues operating but faces increasing sanctions pressure; Indian imports plunged 29% in December 2025 as refiners pulled back.

### Venezuela collapsed, Libya surged, both are noise

Venezuelan production collapsed to **~500 kb/d** following Maduro's seizure by US forces on January 3, 2026, with ~40 mb in storage and infrastructure in dire condition. Recovery requires $10-20 billion and years. Libya has surged to **1.375-1.4 mb/d** â€” the highest since 2011 â€” with a $20 billion TotalEnergies/ConocoPhillips deal signed in January, but political fragility means disruption risk remains moderate.

### Tail risk scenario probabilities

- **$100+ Brent** (Iran war + Hormuz disruption): **10-15% probability**. Requires removing 3-5+ mb/d for weeks. The only credible trigger is a sustained Israel-Iran conflict targeting oil infrastructure or temporarily closing the Strait.
- **$40-50 Brent** (surplus materializes fully): **30-40% probability**. Several pathways: OPEC+ discipline collapse, Russia-Ukraine peace deal (Goldman sees $51 downside), China demand shock, or global recession from tariff escalation. The EIA already forecasts $53/bbl by 2027.

---

## Section 5 â€” Three price scenarios with uncomfortable asymmetry

### The OPEC floor and shale ceiling define the battlefield

OPEC+ is defending an informal **floor of ~$60 Brent** through supply management. Below this level, the group would face mounting pressure to cut further â€” JPMorgan warns additional cuts may be needed to prevent a slide toward $40. The US shale ceiling sits at **~$65-70 Brent** (~$60-65 WTI): above this, rigs return and production re-accelerates within 6-9 months. This creates a theoretical trading band, though both boundaries are porous.

Speculative positioning has recovered from the first-ever combined WTI net short in August 2025 and a **15-year managed money net short extreme** in early January 2026. As of February 3, combined Brent + WTI managed money net longs reached **341,300 contracts** â€” a 6-month high but still well below historical averages. The recovery from extreme bearish positioning is a contrarian bullish signal, but one that fights the fundamental surplus.

### Investment bank consensus and its biases

| Bank | Brent 2026 avg | Key view |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Goldman Sachs | **$56** | Most bearish; short oil recommendation |
| JP Morgan | **$58** | Warns of $30s by 2027 |
| Morgan Stanley | **$57.50-60** | Surplus peaks mid-2026 |
| Citi | **$62** | Bear case: <$50 (30% prob) |
| Bank of America | **$60** | $60-80 range through 2031 |
| EIA | **$58** | Q1 $64 â†’ Q4 $54 trajectory |
| Reuters poll (34 analysts) | **$61.27** | Consensus proxy |

The consensus clusters at **$58-62 average**, skewed bearish. Correcting for typical sell-side bullish bias (banks have historically overestimated oil prices by $5-8/bbl on average during surplus periods), the realistic central expectation is probably closer to **$55-58**.

### Scenario matrix: 6-12 month horizon

**Bull case: Brent $72-85 â€” Probability 15%.** Requires Iran supply disruption (3.2 mb/d at risk), Chinese stimulus exceeding expectations, and accelerated US shale decline. BloombergNEF models $71 Q2 rising to $91 Q4 if Iranian exports halt completely. Any two major bullish catalysts coinciding could push prices to $75-85 temporarily.

**Base case: Brent $55-65, averaging ~$58-60 â€” Probability 55%.** OPEC+ manages supply cautiously, non-OPEC grows 1.4-1.6 mb/d, demand grows 1.0-1.2 mb/d, resulting in a 1.0-1.5 mb/d surplus with gradual inventory builds. Geopolitical risk premium of $3-5 persists but no major disruption. H1 likely $62-68 (seasonal support + geopolitics), H2 $55-60 as surplus weighs.

**Bear case: Brent $42-52 â€” Probability 30%.** OPEC+ discipline collapse, Russia-Ukraine ceasefire with sanctions easing (+0.5-1.0 mb/d), or global recession. Goldman explicitly warns of $40s in 2026-2027. This probability rises to ~40% if OPEC+ accelerates unwinding AND recession hits simultaneously.

### Structural view: 2027-2030

The 3-5 year outlook is more constructive. **2026-2027 marks the trough** of a supply wave as pre-pandemic FIDs come online simultaneously. From 2028 onward, Goldman expects Brent recovering to **$75-80** as: (a) the supply wave ends, (b) 15+ years of upstream underinvestment creates a gap, (c) US shale marginal costs rise toward $95/bbl, and (d) non-OPEC supply growth peaks. The sustainable Brent range considering marginal cost ($55-70), OPEC fiscal needs ($70+), and demand elasticity is **$60-80** through 2031 (Bank of America). Real prices are likely range-bound with an **upward bias after 2027**.

---

## Section 6 â€” Brazilian E&P: FX is the unsung hero

### Brazil's production machine keeps delivering

Brazil produced a record **3.77 mb/d of oil** in 2025 (+12.3% YoY), with total oil and gas reaching **4.99 million boe/d**. The EIA forecasts ~4.0 mb/d in 2026. Pre-salt dominates at **~80% of production**, with industry-leading breakevens below **$40/bbl** and lifting costs of just **$5-7/bbl** for Petrobras. EPE projects Brazilian production peaking at **5.1 mb/d in 2032**, with pre-salt reaching ~4 mb/d by 2030. Petrobras has committed **$111 billion in capex** for 2026-2030, targeting 4.5 million boe/d operated production by 2029.

The regulatory environment is supportive: recent reforms (Law 15,075/2024) allow local content flexibility and royalty reductions for new production units. Pre-salt PSA blocks carry **15% royalties** plus variable profit oil; concession regime blocks pay **10% royalties** plus progressive participaÃ§Ã£o especial (0-40%).

### Company profiles reveal divergent risk-reward

| Metric | PETR4 | PRIO3 | BRAV3 | RECV3 |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Production (boe/d) | **3.1M** | **~120-130k** (â†’200k+) | **81.3k** | **~27k** |
| Lifting cost ($/bbl) | **$5-7** | **$10-11** (norm.) | **$13-16** | **$13.6-15.5** |
| Breakeven (Brent) | **~$59** | **~$35-45** | **~$45-55** | **~$29** (cash) |
| Net Debt/EBITDA | **1.53x** | **~2.0x** | **2.3x** | **1.0x** |
| 2025 stock return | **-9.9%** | **-9.8%** | **-31%** | **-20%** |
| YTD 2026 | **+20%** | Recovering | Volatile | Weak |
| Forward P/E | **~4.5x** | **~6-8x** | **~2.8x** | **~4.2x** |
| Dividend yield | **~8.9%** | ~0% | Minimal | **~14.5%** |

**PRIO3** offers the most compelling growth story: Wahoo first oil expected March-April 2026 (+40 kb/d), with production potentially doubling to **>200 kb/d** by mid-2026. However, leverage at 2.0x post-Peregrino acquisition creates vulnerability if Brent drops below $55. **PETR4** is the defensive anchor â€” pre-salt lifting costs of $5-7/bbl provide massive margin insulation, though political risk in the 2026 election year and rising capex ($19.4 billion in 2026) are concerns. **BRAV3** is the highest risk-reward turnaround, trading at 2.8x forward P/E after a 31% decline in 2025, with leverage improving from 3.4x to 2.3x. **RECV3** has the most conservative balance sheet (1.0x leverage) and highest dividend yield (14.5%) but limited production growth visibility.

### The BRL sensitivity matrix is the critical decision tool

Revenue per barrel in BRL = Brent (USD) Ã— USD/BRL. Current USD/BRL is **~R$5.22**, having strengthened ~5% YTD from R$5.52.

| Brent â†“ \ USD/BRL â†’ | **5.00** | **5.20** | **5.40** | **5.60** | **5.80** | **6.00** | **6.20** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **$55** | 275 | 286 | 297 | 308 | 319 | 330 | 341 |
| **$60** | 300 | 312 | 324 | 336 | 348 | 360 | 372 |
| **$65** | 325 | 338 | 351 | 364 | 377 | 390 | 403 |
| **$70** | 350 | 364 | 378 | 392 | 406 | 420 | 434 |
| **$75** | 375 | 390 | 405 | 420 | 435 | 450 | 465 |
| **$80** | 400 | 416 | 432 | 448 | 464 | 480 | 496 |

At current spot (~$68 Brent, 5.22 USD/BRL), revenue is **~R$355/bbl**. At EIA's 2026 average forecast ($58 Brent) with current FX, revenue falls to **R$303/bbl** â€” a 15% decline. However, a BRL depreciation to 6.00 at $60 Brent yields R$360/bbl â€” comparable to today. **The FX offset is a natural hedge: ~15% BRL depreciation fully compensates for ~15% Brent decline.** With the BCB signaling potential rate cuts from March 2026, some BRL weakening is plausible, which would partially cushion the oil price downside for domestic producers.

## Section 8 â€” The uncomfortable conclusion: bearish fundamentals, bullish tail risks

**Directional view: Range-bound to bearish. Conviction: HIGH (75%) for 6-12 months.**

The base case of **Brent $55-65 averaging ~$58-60** carries 55% probability. The bear case ($42-52) at 30% probability is larger than the bull case ($72-85) at 15%. This creates a **negatively skewed expected value** â€” the probability-weighted outcome is roughly $56-58 Brent, consistent with the EIA forecast and Goldman/JPM views.

The asymmetry assessment, however, is nuanced. The **options market disagrees with the futures market**: Brent risk reversals at 18.69 (comparable to March 2022 during the Russian invasion) signal that sophisticated participants see meaningful upside tail risk that the flat price doesn't reflect. If Iran escalation materializes â€” 25-35% probability â€” the price move could be **+$20-30/bbl** versus a likely **-$10-15/bbl** move in the bear case. This means the distribution of outcomes is bimodal, not Gaussian: the most likely path is grinding lower ($55-60), but the tail scenario is sharply higher ($80+). For hedgers and long-only investors, this creates an environment where buying downside protection is cheap (puts are historically inexpensive relative to calls) and upside optionality is expensive but potentially valuable.

**Catalyst timeline:**
- **March 1, 2026:** OPEC+ monthly meeting â€” extension of Q1 pause likely
- **March-May 2026:** Seasonal refinery ramp-up, potential temporary price support
- **Q2 2026:** Wahoo (PRIO) first oil; Iran negotiations progress/collapse
- **June 7, 2026:** Full OPEC+ ministerial â€” critical 2027 policy direction
- **H2 2026:** Surplus intensifies if OPEC+ begins unwinding; EIA sees Q4 Brent at $54
- **2027+:** Market rebalancing as supply wave crests; structural recovery toward $70-80

**View-changing events (would flip to bullish):** (1) Sustained Iran supply disruption removing >2 mb/d; (2) OPEC+ announces surprise additional cuts of >500 kb/d; (3) China launches major fiscal stimulus with oil demand impact >300 kb/d above consensus; (4) US shale production declines >500 kb/d faster than forecast. **View-changing events (would flip to more bearish):** (1) OPEC+ accelerates production unwind; (2) Russia-Ukraine ceasefire with sanctions rollback; (3) China SPR buying ceases; (4) Global recession.

For Brazilian E&P investors, the key insight is that **the BRL/USD rate matters almost as much as Brent** in determining domestic profitability. At base-case Brent ($58-60) and current FX (5.22), BRL revenue per barrel falls ~15% from current levels. But if the BCB cuts rates and the BRL weakens to 5.60-5.80, the revenue decline is partially cushioned to 5-8%. Among Brazilian names, **PETR4 offers the best downside protection** (pre-salt breakeven, 8.9% dividend yield, political cycle support), **PRIO3 offers the best risk-reward if execution delivers** (production doubling, analysts target R$55-62 vs ~R$40 current), and **BRAV3 at 2.8x forward P/E is pricing in a bear case** that may already be reflected. The consensus is correct that the oil market is oversupplied â€” but the consensus may be underpricing how quickly OPEC+ and shale supply respond to sub-$55 prices, and how consequential the Iran risk truly is.
